Definition:
A storage that is used for keeping and organizing data is called a data structure.
It is a method of setting up data on a computer to make it easily accessible and up to date.

Importance of Data Structures:-
- It is simple to modify data structures. 
- It takes less time. 
- The large database can be accessed easily.
- Saves memory for storage. 

Linear Data Structure- 
A linear data structure is one in which the data elements are ordered sequentially or linearly,
with each element connected to its immediate neighbour.
In this, single level is included.


Non-Linear Data Structure-
A non-linear data structure is the one in which data elements are connected in a hierarchial manner.
In this, multiple levels are included.


Time Complexity- study of efficiency of an algorithm.
Space Complexity- study of how much memory is required by an algorithm.
