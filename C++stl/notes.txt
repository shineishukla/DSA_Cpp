C++ STL( Standard Template Library ) 
It is a powerful set of C++ template classes to provide general-purpose classes and functions with templates that 
implement many popular and commonly used algorithms and data structures like vectors, lists, queues, and stacks.

It is a collection of algorithm's, data structures and other components. 

4 Components:
1. Algorithms
2. Containers
3. Functions
4. Iterators

Advantages of C++ STL:
1. Saves time and space
2. Reusable code
3. Reliable code as it is thoroughly tested
4. Faster execution due to optimized code

Disadvantages of C++ STL:
1. Difficult to learn
2. Difficult to debug
3. Difficult to understand
4. Difficult to modify

#include <bits/stdc++.h> : This header file includes all the standard library. 


Containers:
1. Sequence Containers: vector, list, deque, arrays
2. Associative Containers: set, multiset, map, multimap 
3. Derived Containers: stack, queue, priority_queue
